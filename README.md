1. The general problem to be solved with this program is that the code from Assignment Two was not user friendly as it involved taking 
command line input for the entire user interface. This isn't ideal as the average user will not know how to intuitively use that program.
To solve that issue, I've developed a complete graphical user interface (or GUI) for the purpose of promoting an intuitive user experience, 
where anyone who hasn't used the program before can fairly quickly pick it up.

2. One of the limitations of my code is that it still must be accessed using a command line in Java to run it. One thing I could do is generate an executable using my java files so that this program can reliably be run on any Windows computer, without having to work with a command line to run the program.

3. A user can compile my program using the line "javac *.java" when inside the directory. They can then run the program, after 
going one directory up, by entering "java.ePortfolio.Portfolio fileName.txt" into the command line on a system with Java installed. "fileName.txt" 
represents a file with stored data from another session. They can then use any of the given menu options, beginning with "buy." From there, they can update the price, sell a stock/fund, calculate their gain on paper, search for a given stock/fund based on symbol, keyword, or price range.

The program is tested for correctness using the given Test Plan:

Test Case 1:
- Functionality: Buy
- Input: Type of investment is not a stock or fund
- Output: "Please input either stock or mutual fund" and is reprompted to enter type of investment

Test Case 2:
- Functionality: Buy
- Input: Entered stock/fund symbol is already in the system
- Output: User is not prompted for name, only quantity and price

Test Case 3:
- Functionality: Buy
- Input: Entered stock/fund symbol is not already in the system
- Output: User is prompted for name, quantity and price

Test Case 4:
- Functionality: Sell
- Input: Entered a stock/fund symbol not in the system
- Output: "Please enter a valid symbol" and is reprompted for a valid symbol

Test Case 5:
- Functionality: Sell
- Input: Entered a stock/fund symbol in the system
- Output: User is prompted for quantity and price

Test Case 6:
- Functionality: Sell
- Input: Quantity entered is greater than quantity available to sell
- Output: "Please enter a quantity no greater than X" with X representing the available quantity and is reprompted for quantity

Test Case 7:
- Functionality: Sell
- Input: Quantity entered is greater than quantity available to sell
- Output: "Please enter a quantity no greater than X" with X representing the available quantity and is reprompted for quantity

Test Case 8:
- Functionality: Sell
- Input: All fields for symbol, keyword, and range are left empty
- Output: Return all stocks and funds

Test Case 9:
- Functionality: Sell
- Input: Symbol matching a stock/fund is entered and other fields are left blank
- Output: Return matching stock/fund

Test Case 10:
- Functionality: Sell
- Input: Keywords matching the name of a stock/fund are inputted
- Output: All stocks/funds with all matching keywords are outputted, regardless of order or case sensitivity

Test Case 11:
- Functionality: Sell
- Input: A single number for price range is inputted
- Output: Any stock/fund with price matching that value are returned

Test Case 12:
- Functionality: Sell
- Input: A range of form "X-Y" with X being lower bounds and Y being upper bounds of price are entered
- Output: All stocks/funds within that price range are outputted

Test Case 12:
- Functionality: Sell
- Input: A range of form "X-" with X being lower bounds is entered
- Output: All stocks/funds with at least X price are returned

Test Case 13:
- Functionality: Sell
- Input: A range of form "-X" with X being lower bounds is entered
- Output: All stocks/funds with at most X price are returned

Test Case 14:
- Functionality: Command Loop
- Input: An input not matching any of the functions is entered
- Output: "Please enter one of the options [1,6]"

Test Case 15:
- Functionality: File Loading, filename "investments.txt"
- Input: 

        type = "stock"
        symbol = "YEET"
        name = "Yeet Inc."
        quantity = "10"
        price = "25.0"
        bookValue = "259.99"

        type = "stock"
        symbol = "AAPL"
        name = "Apple Inc."
        quantity = "500"
        price = "142.23"
        bookValue = "55049.99"

    Function: Entered all data successfully

Test Case 16:
- Functionality: File Outputting, filename "investments.txt"
- Input: Through buy,

        type = "stock"
        symbol = "YEAX"
        name = "Yeaxamellon Inc."
        quantity = "10"
        price = "25.0"
        bookValue = "259.99"

        type = "stock"
        symbol = "AAPL"
        name = "Apple Inc."
        quantity = "500"
        price = "142.23"
        bookValue = "55049.99"

        type = "mutualfund"
        symbol = "DELL"
        name = "Dell Inc."
        quantity = "99"
        price = "250"
        bookValue = "55049.99"
        
- Function: Returned file output (should be identical):

        type = "stock"
        symbol = "YEAX"
        name = "Yeaxamellon Inc."
        quantity = "10"
        price = "25.0"
        bookValue = "259.99"

        type = "stock"
        symbol = "AAPL"
        name = "Apple Inc."
        quantity = "500"
        price = "142.23"
        bookValue = "55049.99"

        type = "mutualfund"
        symbol = "DELL"
        name = "Dell Inc."
        quantity = "99"
        price = "250"
        bookValue = "55049.99"

Test Case 17:
- Functionality: Buy page, reset button
- Input: Button is pressed
- Output: All fields are cleared, with type changed to default of Stock

Test Case 18:
- Functionality: Sell page, reset button

- Output: All fields are cleared

5. If I had extra time available, I would:
    - Program a function to change the commision values
    - Create functionality to change a stock or fund name after it was created
    - Generate an executable to be distributed
